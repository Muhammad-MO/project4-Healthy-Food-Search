# About this site.

We were presented with a task to reflect what we have learned about Python and Django and enabling CRUD functions.
I took the opportunity to create a E-comerce websie where users can purchase healthy food items
The website is programmed with the ability to allow a consumer/user to search for their favourite healthfood , add it to the cart and purchase. The consumer 
can also create reviews, delete reviews and see other reviews.
There is also a function where an admin can log in and perform CRUD on the products either in the backend or from the frontend. Ths feature is only available to Admin or SuperUSer

# Programmig Languages used
1. HTML

# Features

The overall website's look is achieved as planned. Users are able to search and purchase their favourite healthfood , add to cart, purchase via a credit card, create reviews and leave reviews.

The admin / superuser is able to update, delete, create new food
items leave a feedback and perform the same functions the user does.

# Features left to implement

The future plans for this website is to add discount and coupon popues for the past consumers

There are also plans to increase the Emart database and make the site searchable by producer and price
